# Kanye West Quote Generator

This project was issued by [SOC](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) to learn some basics of Vanilla JavaScript, CSS, HTML, fetch() & API's. Prior to this I had never worked with fetch() requests, I never knew what an API is or how to receive data from an API ("Application Programming Interface").

# Main Learning Points:
-   Learning how to write an async function
-   Use fetch to send a GET request to an API
-   Call the .json() method on the response variable to parse the JSON data contained in the response object
-   Store the resolved value of the returned promise in a variable called data
-   How to view the API Data on the browser console
-   Attach an event listener to the button
-   Create a function that takes in a string, creates a new list item with that string, and adds it to the ol 
-	  Learn further how HTML elements works / The relationship between the DOM, CSS & JavaScript

I'm sure there are lots of improvements and learning to do around the above topics but I found working with them so much fun and it was great to learn more new things to add to my arsenal!
